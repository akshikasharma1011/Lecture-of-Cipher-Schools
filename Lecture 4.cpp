Code Breakdown:

#include <iostream>: This line includes the iostream header file, which provides functionalities for input/output operations in C++. 
                      It's necessary for using cout to print to the console.
  
using namespace std;: This line tells the compiler to use the std namespace, which contains standard C++ objects like cout and cin.

int main(){: This line defines the main function, which is the entry point of the program. All code execution starts from here.

int a,b,c;: This line declares three integer variables named a, b, and c. They are currently not assigned any values.

a=5; b=5; c=6;: These lines assign values to the previously declared variables. a and b are both set to 5, and c is set to 6.

int d=a+b-c;: This line declares an integer variable d and assigns the result of the expression a + b - c to it. In this case, d will hold the value (5 + 5) - 6 = 4.

cout << d;: This line uses cout from the std namespace to print the value stored in variable d (which is 4) to the console.

return 0;: This line indicates successful program termination by returning 0 from the main function.
